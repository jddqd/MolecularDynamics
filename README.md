Modeling of activated carbon adsorption

Modeling of the adsorption of an activated carbon in a closed chamber under conditions of temperature and pressure fixed at the beginning.
The algorithm is based on a semi-empirical method to adjust the adsorption proportions (here chlorine). 
The body is a molecular dynamics algorithm based on the verlet method where the adsorption phenomenon has been added.
